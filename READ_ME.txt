This is currently the alpha version of the Uranus_AuroraKeck_0905 code used to detect the IR aurora at Uranus

To correctly use the following scripts please ensure the latest versions (as of 15/01/2022) of matplotlib, numpy, math, h3ppy, lmfit, PIL, 

The text files DataKeck06 contains the Times of all data points in this study, along with their approximate longitude and latitude positions on Uranus (as determined by Horizons)

The folder named Headers contains all the header information of spectras taken during the night of observations (including Neptune observations in the first quarter)

To produce the figures, users should carry out Uranus_TimeToLongv2 and KeckDatah3ppy first before running any of the 2D_3DConversion scripts.

Further updates to shortly begin!
