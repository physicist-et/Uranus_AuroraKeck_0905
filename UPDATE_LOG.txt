Editted Line 376 on KeckDatah3ppy_Unrough3 so that New_Temp's 0 values aren't converted to np.nan (as this causes issues in plotting the Temperature later)
Editted Line 420 on KeckDatah3ppy_Unrough3 so that New_TE's 0 values aren't converted to np.nan (same as above)
Added in the gaussstar.py file for the Reduction Script
Editted Line 148 to 151 so that all pixels are considered when calculating the gaussian fit values for Intensities of Q1 and Q3

Identified issue in comparible data use in KeckDatah3ppy_Unrough3 (compared to KeckIntensityStep5) (this will be addressed in tomorrow's update)
Included Keck_Pixel_SelectionY for where MiddlePointData data files originates
Ideas are to update names and comments once issue is resolved

20th January 2022
Issue resolved and method for Pixel selection from KeckIntensityStep5 has been used (which finds the longest line of pixels above or below 2stds from the mean)
Deleted Keckh3ppyTestingPix script
Renamed files dependant on which figure they assist and in what order they should be run in (this is also mentioned in the READ_ME text)

21st January 2022
Renamed multiple files for ease of understanding
