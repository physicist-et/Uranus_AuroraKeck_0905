Editted Line 376 on KeckDatah3ppy_Unrough3 so that New_Temp's 0 values aren't converted to np.nan (as this causes issues in plotting the Temperature later)
Editted Line 420 on KeckDatah3ppy_Unrough3 so that New_TE's 0 values aren't converted to np.nan (same as above)
Added in the gaussstar.py file for the Reduction Script
Editted Line 148 to 151 so that all pixels are considered when calculating the gaussian fit values for Intensities of Q1 and Q3
